# QLD River Measurements Map iOS App

Shows the heights of QLD Rivers on a Map, using data from the Bureau of Meteorology, in an iOS application.

This was a prototype developed in 2016 to try an idea out (and to test out F# in iOS) inspired from discussions with a good friend who contracted for QLD Main Roads.

This was developed in 2016, so there are no guarantees that any of it will work.

I'm putting this out there in case it inspires or humours someone.

Note: I am not an expert in iOS nor am I an expert in F#, however I'm happy to take pull requests or feedback on my F#.
